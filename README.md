### Neural Network Vs Perceptron
Neural Networks when compared to Perceptron captures most of the non-linearly separable points from the data. From the plot III also we can’t identify many misclassifications like we found in Perceptron in plot II since our misclassifications count is very minimum. Main advantage of Neural Network model to capture those non-linearity’s and is achieved with the usage of the activation function. Here in Neural network model, we use tanh as the activation function whereas Perceptron modes uses step function as the activation function which acts simply like a hard – EM and it fails to capture the most of the non-linearity contents in the data. 2. Also major differences is in Perceptron we have only two layers i.e., one input layer and output layer and hence it is difficult to separate the non-linearly separable data. But it is sensitive to initialisation and converges for linearly separable data. In Neural Network it has 3 layers i.e, input, hidden & output layer where it can separate non-linearly separable data properly with less misclassification error. Neural networks follows back-propagation for maximising the likelihood of an object.
